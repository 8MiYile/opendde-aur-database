  #   produces a more optimized binary, but uses a lot of RAM during
  #   compilation - disable if low on memory.
  # 
  # CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  #   can be changed to CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to get a debug build,
  #   which will run signifincantly slower but enables more runtime
  #   checks and generates better crash reports.
