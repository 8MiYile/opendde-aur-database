  # The targets typedefs and types need to be built when building from GIT
  # (README:239-246). The README file mistakenly specifies to run configure
  # after these. They require configure to have been run. As of version
  # 5.99.43beta+10+gfe9dcc2b these targets break building outside of the source
  # tree (as is my custom to do). That is why I am using cd $_sourcedir.
